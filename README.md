## 🧠 AI Model Architecture

### **Ensemble Learning Approach**

The application uses multiple machine learning models and selects the best performer:

1. **Random Forest Regressor**

   - 100 estimators with depth control
   - Handles non-linear relationships
   - Provides feature importance

2. **Gradient Boosting Regressor**

   - Sequential learning with error correction
   - Excellent for time series patterns
   - Robust to overfitting

3. **Linear Regression**
   - Simple baseline model
   - Good for linear trends
   - Fast computation

### **Feature Engineering**

- **Technical Indicators**: RSI, MACD, Bollinger Bands, Moving Averages
- **Lagged Features**: Previous day returns and volume ratios
- **Normalized Features**: Scaled and ratio-based indicators
- **Volume Analysis**: Trading volume patterns and anomalies

### **Validation Strategy**

- **Time Series Cross-Validation**: Prevents look-ahead bias
- **Walk-Forward Analysis**: Realistic backtesting approach
- **Model Comparison**: Automatic best model selection
- **Confidence Metrics**: R² scores and standard deviations

## 🔧 Advanced Configuration

### **Custom Model Parameters**

You can modify model parameters in `stock_predictor_app.py`:

```python
# Random Forest settings
RandomForestRegressor(
    n_estimators=100,        # Number of trees
    max_depth=10,           # Maximum tree depth
    min_samples_split=10,   # Minimum samples to split
    min_samples_leaf=5,     # Minimum samples per leaf
    random_state=42
)

# Gradient Boosting settings
GradientBoostingRegressor(
    n_estimators=100,       # Number of boosting stages
    max_depth=6,           # Maximum tree depth
    learning_rate=0.1,     # Learning rate
    random_state=42
)
```

### **Feature Selection**

Current features can be customized by modifying the `feature_columns` list:

```python
self.feature_columns = [
    'MA_Ratio_5_20',        # Moving average ratios
    'MA_Ratio_20_50',
    'Price_to_MA20',
    'Volatility_5',         # Volatility measures
    'Volatility_20',
    'Volume_Ratio',         # Volume analysis
    'RSI_Normalized',       # Technical indicators
    'MACD',
    'MACD_Histogram',
    'BB_Position',          # Bollinger Band position
